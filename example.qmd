## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you **Render**, a document will be generated that includes *both* content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|

| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |
